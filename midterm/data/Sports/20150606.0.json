Son of the late Madeline Childress and T. Edmund Beck, Beck was born in Mount Vernon, NY on March 10, 1932. He attended Phillips Exeter Academy before graduating from the Wooster School in 1949. He earned a BA in History from his beloved Princeton University in 1953. While at Princeton, Beck was part of a nationally ranked crew team that narrowly missed capturing an Olympic berth for the 1952 games. He captained the varsity crew team the following year. Immediately following college, Beck served in the US Navy rising to the rank of Lieutenant (J.G.). He went on to earn an MBA from Harvard Business School in 1958 before joining Beck, Mack & Oliver, an investment counseling firm founded by his father and two of his father's Princeton colleagues. Beck became a partner in 1962 and later, Senior Partner. During his time with Beck, Mack & Oliver, based on his own investment prowess and extraordinarily personable style, Beck oversaw the firm's growth to becoming a leader in investment counseling. His advice and investment acumen were sought from individuals and institutions alike. He served on many boards, including Russell Reynolds Associates, the Chubb Corporation, Colonial Williamsburg, and most preciously to him, Princeton University. As a trustee at Princeton, he chaired the University's Investment Committee and during his tenure, created the Princeton Investment Company (Princo) which continues to manage the University's endowment. Beck prided himself as much on his personal touch as his facility with numbers. Even at six foot five, he was approachable, his often intimidating facade giving way to a warm, welcome, and very quick sense of humor. Still, he relished competition and put his size and wily southpaw to good use in racquet sports, in particular. Following in the footsteps of his mother, Beck became a nationally ranked platform tennis player in the mid 70's, taking the National Mixed Doubles title with his sister, Susan Beck Wasch, in 1972 and the National Men's title with Herbert Fitzgibbon in 1974. He was also an avid if not often successful fly fisherman and hunter. He reluctantly retired from Beck, Mack & Oliver in 1997 but took comfort in handing the reins of the firm to his eldest son, Robert Childress Beck of New York, NY. Beck maintained his primary residence in Bedford, NY. He is survived by his wife of fourteen years, Marilyn McClure Plumb Beck, and four other children from his first marriage to the former Mary Boulton Fiske (Beck): William Fiske Beck of Chappaqua, NY, Susanne Boulton Beck of Boston, MA, Christopher Mackay Beck of Mendham, NJ, and Edwin Wells Beck of Darien, CT. He also leaves behind fourteen grandchildren, his younger sister, Susan Wasch Beck, of Middletown, CT, and his older brother, Thaddeus Edmund Beck Jr. of Vienna, VA. Services will be held on Thursday, June 25th at 11AM at Saint Matthew's Episcopal Church, 382 Cantitoe St, Bedford, NY. In lieu of flowers, donations may be made to The Wooster School, 91 Miry Brook Rd, Danbury, CT 06810, to support financial aid; or to the Michael J. Fox Foundation, P.O.
