Louis Mazzella, 78, former Chairman-CEO of Colonial Insurance Co. and a New York City real estate investor, died peacefully December 22, 2014 in Boca Raton, FL, following a brief illness. He was admired for his enduring humor in the face of any adversity, and respected for his humble generosity to help ease struggles of children's diseases. He was a major benefactor to St. Jude Children's Research Hospital and Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center. His final moments were shared with family members at bedside, including his wife of 53 years Anne (nee DeBechevet), sons Michael (wife Melanie) of Long Beach, CA, and Louis (wife Mary Ann) of Boca Raton, FL, grandsons Andrews and Matthew, and several nieces and nephews. Born and reared in Brooklyn, he was one of three children of Rose and Louis Vincent Mazzella who built a successful grocery business and where the young Louis learned his business skills at an early age. His brother and sister predeceased him, as did his daughter Carole Anne, who died of an incurable disease on her 10th birthday. A foundation was established in her name to help cure childrens diseases. Mr. Mazzella attended Brooklyn Technical High School and Brooklyn College, and served in the US Army from 1953-1955, receiving a medal for rescuing two sleeping two comrades from their barracks inferno. His desire to help others was life- long. While driving across the California desert once with his young wife, whom he'd married June 17, 1961, they witnessed a vehicle overturn, hurling an infant from the car. He and his wife, a surgical nurse, performed emergency CPR to save the childs life. He never took credit for the incident, nor any of his other generous acts to help schools, charities, sports leagues, arts organizations and animal rescues. The family always had two or more dogs, and an occasional cat, as beloved members. Mr. Mazzella, who formerly resided in the opulent Seward Mansion off Fifth Avenue which he had rescued from development, was also a successful real estate investor in New York and other regions. His success in the insurance field came after acquiring a small regional insurance underwriter and turning it into a significant full-service insurer serving national clients. His outspoken efforts in the mid 1980s at reforming some of his industry's controversial practices at the time was reported in The Wall Street Journal, Forbes, and New York Post, resulting in an inquiry by Congress into the industry, and eventual improvements in regulations. His passions were his family and his devotion to friends. His humility, humor, incredible strength and generosity of spirit that accompanied him each day will continue to endure among many. A Funeral Mass was held January 3, 2015 at 10am in St. Lucy Church in Highland Beach, FL. Separately, a Memorial Mass will be held January 17, 2015 at 10am in Good Shepherd R.C. Church, Brooklyn. Burial will follow at Holy Cross Cemetery, Brooklyn. In lieu of flowers, donations can be made to Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in his name. 1\/3","abstract":null,"print_page":"21","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"Paid Notice: Deaths  MAZZELLA, LOUIS"},"keywords":[{"name":"persons","value":"MAZZELLA, LOUIS"}],"pub_date":"2015-01-11T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"Classified","section_name":"Paid Death Notices","subsection_name":null,"byline":null,"type_of_material":"Paid Death Notice","_id":"54bc82aa38f0d86e1bcc8baf","word_count":"502","slideshow_credits":null},{"web_url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2015\/01\/11\/business\/mutfund\/investment-strategies-for-resolution-breakers.html","snippet":"Two new personal-finance books sympathize with the plight of the weak-willed, offering upbeat advice on how to spend less and save more in the new year....","lead_paragraph":"Two new personal-finance books sympathize with the plight of the weak-willed, offering upbeat advice on how to spend less and save more in the new year.","abstract":"Paul B Brown Off the Shelf column reviews books Picture Your Prosperity: Smart Money Moves to Turn Your Vision into Reality by Ellen Rogin and Lisa Kueng and Money: Master the Game by Tony Robbins.
